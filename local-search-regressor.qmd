title: "Local search with trained XGBoost regressor model"
jupyter: python3
---

## Objective

Test the working and performance of a [previously trained](xgboost-pairwise-ranking.qmd) XGBoost Regressor model in a local search application.

## Background

In previous experiments, we trained an XGBoost Regressor model to predict the objective values of neighboring schedules. In this experiment, we will use the trained models to perform a local search to find the best schedule.

## Hypothesis

The XGBoost Regressor model will be able to efficiently guide the local search algorithm to find a schedule with a lower objective value than the initial schedule.

## Methodology

### Tools and Materials

```{python}
import numpy as np
from itertools import chain, combinations
import sys
from math import comb  # Available in Python 3.8 and later
import xgboost as xgb
from functions import calculate_objective
import pickle
```

### Experimental Design

We will use the trained XGBoost Regressor model to guide a local search algorithm to find the best schedule. The local search algorithm will start with an initial schedule and iteratively explore the neighborhood of the current schedule to find a better one. As an initial schedule, we will use the schedule with the lowest objective value from the training dataset that was used to train the XGBoost Regressor model.

### Variables

-   **Independent Variables**:
    -   The trained XGBoost Regressor model.
-   **Dependent Variables**:
    -   Speed, accuracy, and convergence of the local search algorithm.

### Data Collection

We will use the training dataset to initialize the local search algorithm.

### Sample Size and Selection

```{python}
N = 12 # Number of patients
T = 18 # Number of intervals
d = 5 # Length of each interval
s = [0.0, 0.27, 0.28, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1] # Service times distribution
q = 0.20 # Probability of a scheduled patient not showing up
w = 0.8 # Weight for the waiting time in objective function
num_schedules = 20000 # Number of schedules to sample
```

### Experimental Procedure

## Results

### Load the initial best schedule.

Start with the best solution found so far $\{x^*, C(x^*)\}$ from the training set.

```{python}
# Load the best solution from the training dataset
with open('neighbors_and_objectives.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
    
print(f"The data has following keys: {[key for key in data.keys()]}")

# Step 1: Flatten the objectives into a 1D array
flattened_data = [value for sublist in data['objectives'] for value in sublist]

# Step 2: Find the index of the minimum value
min_index = np.argmin(flattened_data)

# Step 3: Convert that index back to the original 2D structure
row_index = min_index // 2  # Assuming each inner list has 2 values
col_index = min_index % 2

print(f"The minimum objective value is at index [{row_index}][{col_index}].\nThis is schedule: {data['neighbors_list'][row_index][col_index]} with objective value {data['objectives'][row_index][col_index]}.")

# Set the initial schedule to the best solution from the training dataset
initial_schedule = data['neighbors_list'][row_index][col_index]
N = sum(initial_schedule)
T = len(initial_schedule)
```
### Generate the neighborhood of $x^*$.
#### Set T

Set $T$ to the length of the vector $x^*$.

```{python}
T = len(initial_schedule)
```

#### Define $V^*$.

Define the vectors $V^*$ as follows:

```         
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{v_1}, \\
\vec{v_2}, \\
\vec{v_3}, \\
\vdots \\
\vec{v_{T-1}}, \\
\vec{v_T} \\
\end{array}
\right\} = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
(-1, 0,...., 0, 1), \\
(1, -1, 0,...., 0), \\
(0, 1, -1,...., 0), \\
\vdots \\
(0,...., 1, -1, 0), \\
(0,...., 0, 1, -1) \\
\end{array}
\right\}
$$
```

```{python}
def get_v_star(t):
    # Create an initial vector 'u' of zeros with length 't'
    u = np.zeros(t, dtype=int)
    # Set the first element of vector 'u' to -1
    u[0] = -1
    # Set the last element of vector 'u' to 1
    u[-1] = 1
    # Initialize the list 'v_star' with the initial vector 'u'
    v_star = [u]
    # Loop over the length of 'u' minus one times
    for i in range(len(u) - 1):
        # Append the last element of 'u' to the front of 'u'
        u = np.append(u[-1], u)
        # Remove the last element of 'u' to maintain the same length
        u = np.delete(u, -1)
        # Append the updated vector 'u' to the list 'v_star'
        v_star.append(u)
    # Convert the list of vectors 'v_star' into a NumPy array and return it
    return(np.array(v_star))

# Example of function call:
# This will create a 4x4 matrix where each row is a cyclically shifted version of the first row
get_v_star(4)
```

#### Define $U_t$.

Define $U_t$ as the set of all possible subsets of $V^*$ such that each subset contains exactly $t$ elements, i.e.,

$$
U_t = \{ S \subsetneq V^* \mid |S| = t \}, \quad t \in \{1, 2, \dots, T\}.
$$

```{python}
def powerset(iterable, size=1):
    "powerset([1,2,3], 2) --> (1,2) (1,3) (2,3)"
    return [[i for i in item] for item in combinations(iterable, size)]
  
x = initial_schedule

# Generate a matrix 'v_star' using the 'get_v_star' function
v_star = get_v_star(T)

# Generate all possible non-empty subsets (powerset) of the set {0, 1, 2, ..., t-1}
# 'ids' will be a list of tuples, where each tuple is a subset of indices
size = 2
ids = powerset(range(T), size)
len(ids)
ids[:T]
```

#### Define the neighborhood of $x$

Define the neighborhood of $x$ as all vectors of the form $x + u_{tk}$ with $\forall\, u_{tk} \in U_t$.

```{python}
v_star = get_v_star(T)

def get_neighborhood(x, v_star, ids, verbose=False):
    x = np.array(x)
    p = 50
    if verbose:
        print(f"Printing every {p}th result")
    # Initialize the list 'neighborhood' to store the vectors in the neighborhood of 'x'
    neighborhood = []
    # Loop over all possible non-empty subsets of indices
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        # Initialize the vector 'neighbor' to store the sum of vectors in 'v_star' corresponding to the indices in 'ids[i]'
        neighbor = np.zeros(len(x), dtype=int)
        # Loop over all indices in 'ids[i]'
        for j in range(len(ids[i])):
            if verbose:
                print(f"v_star{[ids[i][j]]}: {v_star[ids[i][j]]}")
            # Add the vector in 'v_star' corresponding to the index 'ids[i][j]' to 'neighbor'
            neighbor += v_star[ids[i][j]]
        # Append the vector 'x' plus 'neighbor' to the list 'neighborhood'
        x_n = x + neighbor
        if i%p==0:
            if verbose:
                print(f"x, x', delta:\n{x},\n{x_n},\n{neighbor}\n----------------- ")
        neighborhood.append(x_n)
    
    # Convert the list 'neighborhood' into a NumPy array
    neighborhood = np.array(neighborhood)
    if verbose:
        print(f"Size of raw neighborhood: {len(neighborhood)}")
    # Create a mask for rows with negative values
    mask = ~np.any(neighborhood < 0, axis=1)
    # Filter out rows with negative values using the mask
    if verbose:
        print(f"filtered out: {len(neighborhood)-mask.sum()} schedules with negative values.")
    filtered_neighborhood = neighborhood[mask]
    if verbose:
        print(f"Size of filtered neighborhood: {len(filtered_neighborhood)}")
    return filtered_neighborhood

# Example of function call:
# This will generate the neighborhood of the vector 'x' using the vectors in 'v_star' and the indices in 'ids'
test_nh = get_neighborhood(x, v_star, ids)
print(f"All neighborhoods with {size} patients switched:\n x = {np.array(x)}: \n {test_nh}")
```

### Local search algorithm

```         
1. Generate the neighborhood of $x^*$.
2. For each vector $y$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$:
  a.  Predict $C(y)$.
  b.  If $C(y) < C(x^*)$, set $x^* = y$ and go to 1

3. Return $x^*$.
```

### Run the local search algorithm

```{python}
# Example of using the local search algorithm with a regressor model
# Load regressor model
regressor = xgb.Booster()
regressor.load_model("models/regressor.json")

test = local_search_predicted(initial_schedule, v_star, regressor, T)
print(test)
print(f"Best solution found: {test[0]}, with predicted cost: {test[1]} and real cost: {test[2]}")
```

```{python}
# Computing optimun solution with real cost
print(f"Initial schedule: {test[0]}")
test_x = local_search(test[0], v_star, T)
test_x_pred = np.array(test_x[0]).flatten()  # Keep as 1D array
test_x_pred_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(test_x_pred.reshape(1, -1))
test_c_star_pred = regressor.predict(test_x_pred_dmatrix)[0]
print(f"Best solution found: {test_x [0]}, with true cost: {test_x [1]}, and predicted cost: {test_c_star_pred}")
```
