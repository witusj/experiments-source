        "In this experiment, we will test the validity of existing appointment scheduling heuristics by evaluating several instances of scheduling systems and analyzing the results. We will examine the performance of different scheduling strategies and compare them to the heuristics proposed in the literature. The goal is to find quasi optimal schedules that form a good starting point for further optimization using for instance local search algorithms.\n",

        "The extensive body of research on appointment scheduling offers valuable heuristics for designing schedules that are likely close to optimal. In their seminal work, Welch et al. (1952)[^appointment-scheduling-heuristics-t-larger-n-1] established the following rule: schedule two patients at the beginning of the day to minimize the risk of idle time if one patient does not show up. The remaining patients should then be scheduled at intervals equal to the mean consultation time.\n",

        "The results of the experiments appear to confirm that optimal schedules adhere to the Bailey-Welch rule of scheduling two patients at the start of the day. The remaining patients are then allocated as evenly as possible across the remaining time intervals. When patients' time is valued higher than the physician's, empty intervals are inserted into the schedule to absorb potential spillover times. This adjustment, however, pushes some patients out of the schedule, thereby increasing the total overtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "The local search algorithm required on average 22 and 42 steps for both types of small instances ($w = 0.1$ and $w = 0.9$, respectively) to compute the global optimum. Interestingly the number of steps required to reach the optimal schedule did not increase significantly for the larger instance ($T=20$, $N=\\{21, 22\\}$, $w = 0.5$), despite the larger solution space. This suggests that the local search algorithm is effective in finding the optimal schedule within a reasonable number of steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "In each instance, the most significant reductions in the objective value occurred each time a patient was moved from the last time interval to an earlier one. This adjustment minimized overtime, which apparently has a substantial impact on the objective value.\n",
